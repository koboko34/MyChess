# MyChess
A chess engine/app created using OpenGL and C++.

Currently this app supports 2-player and singleplayer mode against an AI which plays moves at random. In future versions I hope to create a smarter AI by increasing the speed of move generation and evaluating board positions by looking at all possible moves at a specific depth.
