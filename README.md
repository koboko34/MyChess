# MyChess
A chess engine/app created using OpenGL and C++.

Currently this app supports 2-player and singleplayer mode against an AI which plays moves by calculating all possible moves at a given depth and selecting the best move. In future versions I hope to create a smarter AI by increasing the speed of move generation, allowing the AI to see further into the future in the same amount of time.
